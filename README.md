# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description

This project is a simple Python-based Hangman game. The program defines a list of fruits, selects one at random, and then asks the user to guess a letter. The user input is validated to ensure it is a single alphabetical character.

The aim of the project is to learn the basics of Python, including working with lists, user input, conditional statements, and the random module.

**Features**:

- Defines a list of fruits.
- Randomly selects a fruit from the list.
- Prompts the user to guess a letter.
- Validates the user's input to ensure it meets the required conditions.

## Aim of this project

The outcome of this project is to learn and practise:

- Python programming basics
- Utilistaion of Object Oriented Programming to make a hangman game, working with classes and methods
- Handling user input and validating data
- Using control structures such as loops and conditionals

## Installation

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Nad1m-71/hangman670.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed.

## Usage

1. Open you terminal and run the `milestone_5.py` file to start the game.
   ``` 	
   python milestone_5.py
   ```
 
2. Follow the prompts displayed on the screen.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Work with Python lists to store and manipulate data.
- Use the `random` module to select random elements from a list.
- Take user input using the `input()` function and validate it.
- Use conditional statements for input validation.
- Creating and using Python classes and methods.
- Writing modular and reusable code.
